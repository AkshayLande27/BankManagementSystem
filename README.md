 *                Bank Management System                    *
 ************************************************************
 
Description:
This is a simple Bank Management System implemented in C++. 
It allows users to perform various banking operations such as 
creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, 
transferring funds between accounts, and checking the balance.

Features:
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Secure authentication system to access the bank accounts.
- Multi-account support, enabling users to manage multiple bank accounts.
- Robust error handling to ensure smooth operation even in case of unexpected inputs.
- Utilizes object-oriented programming principles for efficient code organization and maintenance.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   $ g++ bank_management_system.cpp -o bank_management_system
3. Run the executable file generated.
   $ ./bank_management_system
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the different banking operations.

Technologies Used:
- C++: Programming language used for implementing the project.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilized to design and structure the codebase efficiently.
- Standard Template Library (STL): Leveraged for data structures like vectors and maps.

Future Improvements:
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience.
- Add support for additional banking functionalities such as loan management and account statements.
- Enhance security measures, possibly by integrating encryption techniques.
- Improve error handling and edge case scenarios to make the system more robust and foolproof.
